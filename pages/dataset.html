                The SherLock data collection agent is based on the
                <a href="http://funf.org/" target="_blank">Google Funf</a>
                framework. The Funf Open Sensing Framework is an extensible sensing and data processing framework for mobile devices, developed by the MIT Media Lab. Funf was not designed for intense frequent feature monitoring, such as computing statistics on
                motion sensors. Therefore, we had to make modifications to the framework's processing pipeline in order to improve stability and reliability. Moreover, we added probes to the framework, such as a probe that collects statistics on all running
                applications. The source code for the SherLock agent, along with its modifications and its complete version history, is available online with the dataset.

                In the Funf framework, monitorable features are referred to as sensors. Funf allows for developers to define groupings of sensors such that they will be sampled together at roughly the same time. These defined groupings are referred to as probes. A
                probe is activated (sampled) according to a configuration provided to the Funf's scheduler. For example, a probe that senses motion can be triggered once every five seconds or whenever some specific event occurs (e.g., the press of the home button).
                Sensors can retrieve data from either physical or virtual sources (e.g., external temperature or memory consumption). In general, there are two types of sensors: PUSH and PULL. PUSH sensors are event-based, such as sensing when an SMS arrives or when
                the screen is turned on. PULL sensors are collected periodically, such as by sampling the CPU utilization or the device's acceleration.

                The data collected by SherLock is stored temporarily on the volunteer's device as a text file in JSON format. Once the file reaches 500MB, it is zipped to ~50MB. Eventually, once the user connects to WiFi, all of the zip files temporarily stored on
                the device are uploaded to our server.

Overall, there are many sensors divided amongst just a few probes. The probes were planned this way
                in order to fuse as many sensor records as possible to individual timestamps. This approach is advantageous when dealing with a large time series datasets because it minimizes the number of JOIN operations required on the final database when

                The most frequently sampled PULL probe is T4, sampled once every five seconds. Each time the T4 probe is triggered, three software sensors are sampled. One sensor collects global features on the device's utilization and statistics down to the Linux
                level. The second collects statistics and Linux level features from each running application. The third collects features regarding the battery and power consumption. The Linux level features are obtained from the Linux virtual /proc directory which

                Moriarty is an agent that perpetrates attacks on the user's device while creating labels for the SherLock dataset. The attacks perpetrated by Moriarty are based on the following attack model: (1) A benign application is either initially given or
                repackaged to include additional code (spyware or some other malware). (2) The victim installs the app from a marketplace without realizing the consequences of the requested permissions. Given this model, we note that Moriarty does not need to
                exploit vulnerabilities on the device in order to perform its malicious activities.

                In terms of its framework, Moriarty is a benign application to which a malicious behavior has been added, for example, a puzzle game that steals the user's contacts. Every few weeks Moriarty is updated to a new version (app + behavior) via the Google
                Play store. If the user forgets to use the Moriarty application for three days, then SherLock reminds the user to do so. For ethical reasons, each version of Moriarty does not contain actual malware code from the wild but rather contains a behavioral
                copy of a malware sample found in the wild. In order to protect the volunteer's privacy, all data sent by Moriarty over the Internet is scrambled (corrupted) before transmission.

                <b>Clues.</b>
                The explicit labels Moriarty creates for the SherLock dataset are referred to as clues. Moriarty creates a clue for each significant benign and malicious action it performs. A benign action is one which the application does as part of its regular
                usage (e.g., a game makes a new view).

            </p>

        <div class="c12">
            <p>
                While Moriarty is running, it can be in one of two modes: malicious or benign. While in malicious mode Moriarty performs its malicious activities in parallel with its benign activities. In benign mode, Moriarty only performs benign activities. The
                purpose of the benign mode is to provide clean (normal) data that can be separated and used as a comparative dataset during the development of anomaly detection algorithms. If Moriarty's malicious behavior runs as a background service, the mode
                changes every 24 hours; otherwise it toggles each time the user runs the application
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="c12">
            <p>
                A session is the duration that Moriarty is in benign mode or malicious mode. All clues recorded during a session are given a session ID. The session ID can be used to extract the desired mode or behavior from the time series data. In cases where
                Moriarty has two malware behaviors (i.e.,v2, v8 and v11) each behavior is performed in different sessions (i.e., they do not overlap in time).

                storage, and sending them offsite. The trace of the three clues belongs to a single session that is malicious. Note that in the first clue the SessionType is malicious, but the Action itself is benign (i.e., part of the application's legitimate
                behavior). The Details field elaborates on the action taken and sometimes includes specifics such as the traffic volume, duration, message content, and so on. All of these fields are parsed into the final SherLock dataset.

                The data collection experiment was divided into four phases: Pilot, Stage 1, Stage 2, and Upkeep (Figure <a ng-click="scrollTo('dataset3')" href="">3</a>). In the Pilot phase, seven volunteers were provided with Galaxy S4 devices and initial prototypes were distributed and
                iteratively improved. In Stage 1, 30 volunteers were provided with a stable version of SherLock and a Galaxy S5 smartphone. At first, the volunteers were provided with a battery case that extended the internal battery, and a few months later they
                were provided with additional battery cases that charge the internal battery from an external battery. These technical differences are important to note, because the latter case charges the phone's internal battery as if it were plugged in to the
                wall, and thus affects the power consumption statistics.

                In Stage 2, Moriarty was deployed and 20 additional volunteers were added (for a total of 50 Galaxy S5 devices). Both agents were then managed through the Google Play store as opposed to manual APK updates. At that point all volunteers were supplied
                with a higher quality battery case that extends the internal battery (Zerolemon 8500MAh). In the Upkeep phase, further updates to SherLock and Moriarty will be sparse, but the data collection will continue until at least January 2018 (for a total of
                three years of data collection).

                The SherLock dataset is organized into data tables, one for each SherLock probe (Tables <a ng-click="scrollTo('dataset6')" href="">2</a> and  <a ng-click="scrollTo('dataset7')" href="">3</a>). Some of the sensors belonging to these probes return a variable number of records when they are sampled -- specifically,
                the WiFi, Bluetooth, and Local App Stats sensors, since they perform surveys over a variable number of entities. The data records from these sensors cannot be stored in the data tables of their parent probes. Therefore the data from these sensors are
                stored in separate tables.

<b>Identifiers.</b> We have received permission from the volunteers to allow others to use their data for research, provided that we anonymize their data. Therefore, network identifiers such as SSIDs, cell tower IDs, and MAC addresses have been hashed. Moreover, the phone numbers in the SMS and call logs have been hashed as well.

<b>Geolocation.</b> The geolocation of each volunteer has been anonymized by performing k-means clustering over the volunteer's longitude, latitude, and altitude. This approach is a method that achieves k-anonymity via generalization. This means that those who receive the dataset will have the volunteer's location in terms of cluster IDs.

To provide this spatio-temporal information in an anonymous manner, we provide additional clusterings using both geolocation and temporal features with k={5,25,100}. Specifically, the temporal features we consider are cyclic time of day, and week. For more information on the cyclic features and how they were calculated please see our paper.
